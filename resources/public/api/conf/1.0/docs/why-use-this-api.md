Agents often use software to perform services for their clients. The API will benefit these agents as it allows them to create a request for authorisation to act on a client's behalf for a specific Making Tax Digital service directly through software.

This process involves the agent providing their own personal identifier and some information about the client that they wish to act on behalf of.
This generates a link that the agent can send to their client. The client can then follow this link to authorise the agent  for a service.

This API will save an agent time as they currently need to use an Agent Services user interface to create an authorisation request using their agent services account.
