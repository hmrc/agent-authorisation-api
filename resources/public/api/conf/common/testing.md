You can use the Sandbox environment to [test this API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/testing). You can test different scenarios in the Sandbox by passing the Gov-Test-Scenario header. The Sandbox also allows you to perform [stateful and dynamic testing](https://developer.qa.tax.service.gov.uk/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/how-to-integrate.html#sandbox-testing) for some APIs. The ‘Test data’ section under each endpoint explains the test scenarios that can be simulated.

If you have a specific testing need that is not supported in the Sandbox, [contact our Software Developers Support Team](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/support). Some endpoints may be marked ‘[test only]’, which means that they are not available for use in Production and may change.
