Use the Agent Authorisation API to:

    * request authorisation to act on a client's behalf for either Making Tax Digital for VAT or Making Tax Digital for Income Tax
    * cancel an authorisation request
    * check the status of authorisations already requested
    * query active or inactive relationships

For information on how to connect to this API [see the Income Tax MTD end-to-end service guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/).
