Agents often use software to perform services for their clients. 
The API will benefit these agents since it will allow them to be able to request the invitation link directly through software, to send to their client so that they can authorise the agent for a service. 
This will save an agent time since currently they must separately log into Agent Services UI to request this link. 
This also aligns with the API first strategy for Agent Services.
