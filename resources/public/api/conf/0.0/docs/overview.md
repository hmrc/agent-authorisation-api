This API allows tax agents to request authorisation to act on a client's behalf for a specific Making Tax Digital (MTD) tax service and have the option to cancel the authorisation request.

The API also allows the agent to check the status of authorisations already requested and query active or inactive relationships.

This API has no effect on the existing XML API.
